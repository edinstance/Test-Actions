# Test-Actions

This repository serves as a testing ground for GitHub actions that I am developing and planning to use in my projects.

## Actions Developed So Far:

1. **Create Branch for New Issue:**
   - This action automatically creates a branch for a new issue when a certain label is added to it.
   - Once the branch is created, it adds a comment to the issue with a link to the newly created branch.
  
2. **Run prettier and lint for a next project
   - This action runs on pull request
   - This action sets up node
   - It then installs all of the needed dependencies
   - It runs the lint commnand

Feel free to explore the actions further and contribute to their development!
