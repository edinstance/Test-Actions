# Java

The Unit tests and Intergration tests actions were created for an internal project at one of my previous companies, They were used in a SpringBoot Java project. The project was built and managed using [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) so the tests are ran using maven commands. The Unit tests were ran using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) and the Intergration tests were ran using [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
