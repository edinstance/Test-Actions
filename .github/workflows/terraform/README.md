# Terraform

These workflows were created while I have been learning [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) Infrastructure, and there is more information about them [here](https://github.com/edinstance/AWS-Infrastructure/). The two current workflows are to lint and perform a security scan for Terraform projects, the Lint workflow uses [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) and the security scan uses [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/).
