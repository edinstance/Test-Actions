# Postgres

These examples are related to deploying and running tests against a postgres database. The current example uses docker to run both a postgres database and liquibase for change management. These workflows were designed to work with my [online-shop-database-example](https://github.com/edinstance/online-shop-database-example) so check it out for more information.
